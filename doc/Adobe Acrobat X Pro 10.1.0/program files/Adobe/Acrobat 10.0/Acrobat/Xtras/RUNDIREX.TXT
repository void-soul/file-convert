% PostScript program for distilling and combining an entire folder or
% directory of PostScript files.
% When embedding font subsets, it is highly recommended you use this technique
% to distill multiple PS files so only one font subset is used for each font.

% INSTRUCTIONS
%
% 1. Place all PostScript files to be distilled and concatenated in a single 
%    directory.  For example, here are example names of PS files that might
%    be used to distill a book:
%
%       ac001.ps	Cover
%       bt001.ps	Table of Contents
%       ch001.ps	Chapter 1
%       ch002.ps	Chapter 2
%       ch003.ps	Chapter 3
%       in001.ps	Index
%
% 2. Make a copy of this file and give it the name you want to have as the prefix
%    for the resulting file. For example, you could name this file MyBook.txt. 
%
% IMPORTANT:  Don't use the .ps suffix if this file is in the same folder as the 
%   rest of your .ps files. The RunDir command will execute all files that end in 
%  .ps and this file will be distilled twice!
%
% 3. Redefine the variable "PathName" above to point to the folder/directory which
%    contains your PS files.
%
%       Macintosh pathname syntax:  /PathName (Macintosh HD:Folder:*.ps) def
%       Windows pathname syntax:    /PathName (c:/mydir/*.ps) def
%		UNIX pathname syntax:    /PathName (.\\/mydir\\/*.ps) def
%
%       Note: The syntax for Windows may look strange, but double escaping the
%             backslash character is required when using filenameforall.
%
% 4. Distill the file on the machine running Acrobat Distiller.
